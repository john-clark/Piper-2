This is 19.9 or 20mm pipe version upgrade (UK version).\
By default, Piper 2 (<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3036472>) is designed to use 8mm guiding rods. Guiding rods will become unstable under belt tension if bed size will be stretched larger than 300mm. This upgrade allows the use of 12 mm rods and 10 mm GT2 belt. It should allow expansion of Piper 2 to a bed size beyond 300mm for example 500x500mm. Some dimensions have changed so bed size will be 123 mm less than Y rod and 113 mm less than X rod.
